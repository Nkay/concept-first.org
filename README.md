# Welcome to concept-first.org

We aim to create this Website together with you - yes, you - to create an information page about a process that should be standard (but isn't).
Out goal is to make everyone understand why creating a concept (at least a rough one) is very important for project success.

In the ideal World, you wouldn't have to argue, but we do, so we'd like this website as a argumentative helper why this is a good idea - and why concept creating should be a paid thing to do.

## Please Help!

Please just add a PR and we will gladly accept it, if it somehow helps our case.

We built this with astro to create a very low entry bar to contibute - see below for documentation.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                             |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`          | Installs dependencies                              |
| `npm run dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`        |
| `npm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`            |
